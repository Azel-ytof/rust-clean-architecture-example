# Clean Architecture

A clean architecture is a software structure that allows developer to keep his code analysable, testable, verifiable and
maintainable.

Robert C. Martin propose that architecture as a layered organization with well-defined responsibilities.

We can compare it to an onion.

## Explanation of my clean architecture

My application is composed of 4 parts :

1. Domain : Contains all entities, errors, ...
2. Business : Contains use cases
3. Infrastructure : Contains repositories (that allows to use dependencies)
4. Application : Contains presenters, view model

## Example in Java

I've wrote the equivalent of this architecture in Java : <https://github.com/Azel-ytof/java-clean-architecture-example>
